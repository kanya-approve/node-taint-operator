# Node Taint Remover

Removes the kubernetes.io/arch from newly created nodes.

## Description

GKE clusters with only ARM nodes do not have a way to set tolerations on pods related to Dataplane V2. This is a quick and dirty means to resolve [this](https://serverfault.com/questions/1141581/gke-arm-based-cluster-starts-in-invalid-state). Some of charts that I install don't have any settings for tolerations.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

    ```sh
    make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/node-taint-remover:tag
    ```

2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

    ```sh
    make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/node-taint-remover:tag
    ```

### Undeploy controller

Undeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

TODO - this will be a short lived tool as I don't think many will find it useful

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

1. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

    ```sh
    make run
    ```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
